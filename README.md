# Customer Churn Prediction System

## 📊 Overview

echo "This project focuses on predicting customer churn, a critical concern for businesses. Leveraging machine learning and a rich dataset, we identify relevant features and build predictive models using techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. We emphasize feature engineering, model evaluation, and interpretability. Our study showcases practical ways to retain at-risk customers, such as personalized incentives and targeted marketing. The project contributes to the development of a customer churn prediction system. By identifying high-risk customers, businesses can take proactive measures to enhance customer retention strategies. This project underscores the importance of data-driven solutions in addressing customer churn, thereby promoting long-term business success."
