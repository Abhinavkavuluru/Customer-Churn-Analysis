## üöÄ Overview

echo "The **Customer Churn Prediction System** project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning techniques. By leveraging models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, this project identifies at-risk customers and helps businesses implement effective retention strategies."

## ‚ú® Features

echo "- **Churn Prediction**: Predict customer churn based on features from the Telecommunication dataset."
echo "- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression."
echo "- **Feature Engineering**: Apply techniques such as Label Encoding and SMOTE to enhance model performance."
echo "- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize data patterns and model results."
