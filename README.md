# Customer Churn Prediction System

![Customer Churn](https://example.com/your-image.png)  <!-- Replace with a relevant image URL -->

## üöÄ Overview

The **Customer Churn Prediction System** project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning techniques. By leveraging models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, this project identifies at-risk customers and helps businesses implement effective retention strategies.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Churn Prediction**: Predict customer churn based on features from the Telecommunication dataset.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.
- **Feature Engineering**: Apply techniques such as Label Encoding and SMOTE to enhance model performance.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize data patterns and model results.
